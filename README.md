Jump - A URL shortener
----------------------

This was originally written by Steve DiDomenico and never used in production at Northwestern. This is a URL shortening CGI which allows users to create a shorter URL when they enter a long one. They can either type in where they would like the URL to go to, or they can let the system choose a series of characters that will redirect.

The script uses a combination of Perl, Apache redirects, and a MySQL database backend.
